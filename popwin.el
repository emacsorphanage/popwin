;;; Commentary:

;; Popwin makes you free from the hell of annoying buffers such like
;; *Help*, *Completions*, *compilation*, and etc.
;;
;; To use popwin, just add the following code into your .emacs:
;;
;;     (require 'popwin)
;;     (setq display-buffer-function 'popwin:display-buffer)
;;
;; Then try to show some buffer, for example *Help* or
;; *Completeions*. Unlike standard behavior, their buffers may be
;; shown in a popup window at the bottom of the frame. And you can
;; close the popup window seamlessly by typing C-g or selecting other
;; windows.
;;
;; `popwin:display-buffer' displays special buffers in a popup window
;; and displays normal buffers as unsual. Special buffers are
;; specified in `popwin:special-display-config', which tells popwin
;; how to display such buffers. See docstring of
;; `popwin:special-display-config' for more information.
;;
;; Instead of a recommended way, you can also use popwin by setting
;; `special-display-function' like:
;;
;;     (require 'popwin)
;;     (setq special-display-function
;;           'popwin:special-display-popup-window)
;;
;; In this case, you need to change `special-display-buffer-names' or
;; `special-display-regexps' so that popwin takes care of such
;; buffers.
;;
;; The default width/height/position of popup window can be changed by
;; setting `popwin:popup-window-width', `popwin:popup-window-height',
;; and `popwin:popup-window-position'.  You can also change the
;; behavior for a specific buffer. See docstring of
;; `popwin:special-display-config'.
